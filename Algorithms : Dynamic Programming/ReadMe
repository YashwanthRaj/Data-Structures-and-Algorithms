# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique. 

## Memoization

Basically means caching, where we store information so that we can store it later on. Caching is used to speedup the programming. 

Memoization is a specific form of caching where it will store a functions/programs return values. 

**Dynamic Programming - Divide & Conquer + Memoization** 

Steps that we see to conclude if a problem can be solved using dynamic programming

1. Can be divided into sub Problem
2. Recursive Solution
3. Are there repetitive subproblems
4. Memoize sub problems
