# Graphs

A set of values that are related in a pair wise fashion. Each vertex is called a node (Vertex). These nodes are connected with Edges. Graphs are ideal when we are dealing with things that connect to other things. In cases of locations, graphs are used to find the shortest path. 

## Directed Graphs

Has directions from one node to another. Used in traffic and other scenarios where direction of movement is necessary. And these are uni directional unless it has edges that direct both ways. 

### Un Weighted

The edges do not have weights. 

### Weighted

The edges have weights.

## Un Directed Graphs

Do not have any direction. They can go back and forth from nodes as there is no specified direction. 

There are also **cyclic** and **acyclic** graph depending upon if the nodes are connected in such a way that they form a cycle i.e if you start from one node, you can travel to the same node in a closed system. 

**Pros of Graph**

Relationships

**Cons of Graph**

Scaling is hard
